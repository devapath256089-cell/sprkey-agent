**The self-improving AI agent built by [Nightrainbow Research](https://nightrainbowresearch.com).** It's the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nightrainbowresearch.com), OpenRouter, OpenAI, your own endpoint, and [many others](https://sprkey-agent.nightrainbowresearch.com/docs/integrations/providers). Switch with `sprkey model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Quick Install

### Linux, macOS, WSL2

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sprkey-agent.nightrainbowresearch.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (native, PowerShell)

> **Heads up:** Native Windows runs Sprkey without WSL — CLI, gateway, TUI, and tools all work natively. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux/macOS one-liner above works there too. Found a bug? Please [file issues](https://github.com/NightrainbowResearch/sprkey-agent/issues).

Run this in PowerShell:

```powershell
iex (irm https://sprkey-agent.nightrainbowresearch.com/install.ps1)
```

The source installer delegates Python 3.14, Node.js, npm, ripgrep, FFmpeg,
and Python dependencies to PM. If Git is absent, it stages the verified Git
for Windows archive in Sprkey' tool store. It does not replace your system Git.
See [installation methods](https://sprkey-agent.nightrainbowresearch.com/docs/getting-started/installation)
for the separate MSIX/App Installer package and its update ownership.

> **Android / Termux:** A signed APT repository is available for aarch64 devices, with a `stable` channel (tagged releases) and a prerelease `canary` channel. The package includes Python, Node.js, and the TUI. Use the [Termux guide](https://sprkey-agent.nightrainbowresearch.com/docs/getting-started/termux), not the desktop/server installer script.
>
> **Windows:** Native Windows is fully supported — the PowerShell one-liner above installs everything. If you'd rather use WSL2, the Linux command works there too. Native Windows install lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\sprkey`; WSL2 installs under `~/.sprkey` as on Linux.

After installation:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc    # reload shell (or: source ~/.zshrc)
sprkey              # start chatting!
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Windows Defender or antivirus flags `uv.exe` as malware

If your antivirus (Bitdefender, Windows Defender, etc.) quarantines `uv.exe` from the Sprkey `bin` folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\sprkey\bin\uv.exe`), this is a **false positive**. The file is Astral's `uv` — the Rust Python package manager Sprkey bundles to manage its Python environment. ML-based antivirus engines commonly flag unsigned Rust binaries that download and install packages.

**To verify your copy is authentic:**

```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Run verification
$uv = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\sprkey\bin\uv.exe"
$ver = (& $uv --version).Split(' ')[1]
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
$zip = "$env:TEMP\uv.zip"
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/$ver/uv-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip" -OutFile $zip -UseBasicParsing
gh attestation verify $zip --repo astral-sh/uv
Expand-Archive $zip "$env:TEMP\uv_x" -Force
(Get-FileHash "$env:TEMP\uv_x\uv.exe").Hash -eq (Get-FileHash $uv).Hash
```

If attestation says "Verification succeeded" and the last line prints `True`, you're good.

**To whitelist Sprkey:**
- **Windows Defender:** Run PowerShell as Admin → `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\sprkey\bin"`
- **Bitdefender:** Add an exception in the Bitdefender console (Protection > Antivirus > Settings > Manage Exceptions)
- Whitelist the **folder**, not the file hash — Sprkey updates `uv` and the hash changes every version

For more context, see the upstream Astral reports: [astral-sh/uv#13553](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13553), [astral-sh/uv#15011](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/15011), [astral-sh/uv#10079](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10079).

## Skip the API-key collection — Nous Portal

Sprkey works with whatever provider you want — that's not changing. But if you'd rather not collect five separate API keys for the model, web search, image generation, TTS, and a cloud browser, **[Nous Portal](https://portal.nightrainbowresearch.com)** covers all of them under one subscription:

- **300+ models** — pick any of them with `/model <name>`
- **Tool Gateway** — web search, image generation (FAL), text-to-speech (OpenAI), cloud browser (Browser Use), all routed through your sub. No extra accounts.

One command from a fresh install:

```bash
sprkey setup --portal
```

That logs you in via OAuth, sets Nous as your provider, and turns on the Tool Gateway. Check what's wired up any time with `sprkey portal info`. Full details on the [Tool Gateway docs page](https://sprkey-agent.nightrainbowresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tool-gateway).

You can still bring your own keys per-tool whenever you want — the gateway is per-backend, not all-or-nothing.

## CLI vs Messaging Quick Reference

Sprkey has two entry points: start the terminal UI with `sprkey`, or run the gateway and talk to it from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, or Email. Once you're in a conversation, many slash commands are shared across both interfaces.

| Action                         | CLI                                           | Messaging platforms                                                              |

| Start fresh conversation       | `/new` or `/reset`                            | `/new` or `/reset`                                                               |
| Change model                   | `/model [provider:model]`                     | `/model [provider:model]`                                                        |
| Set a personality              | `/personality [name]`                         | `/personality [name]`                                                            |
| Retry or undo the last turn    | `/retry`, `/undo`                             | `/retry`, `/undo`                                                                |
| Compress context / check usage | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [--days N]` | `/compress`, `/usage`, `/insights [days]`                                        |
| Browse skills                  | `/skills` or `/<skill-name>`                  | `/<skill-name>`                                                                  |
| Interrupt current work         | `Ctrl+C` or send a new message                | `/stop` or send a new message                                                    |
| Platform-specific status       | `/platforms`                                  | `/status`, `/sethome`                                                            |

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Sprkey can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`sprkey setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
sprkey claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
sprkey claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
sprkey claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
sprkey claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:

- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.sprkey/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `sprkey claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.
