# /opt/sprkey/docker/main-wrapper.sh — wraps the container's CMD with
# the same argument-routing logic the pre-s6 entrypoint.sh used. Runs
# as /init's "main program" (Docker CMD) so it inherits stdin/stdout/
# stderr from the container. The non-PID-1 entrypoint fallback also
# execs this script directly after running the stage2 bootstrap.
#
# Env note: /init scrubs env before invoking CMD, so when this wrapper
# is launched through the supervised path it must rehydrate via
# with-contenv before touching SPRKEY_HOME / PATH. On the non-PID-1
# fallback path the Dockerfile env is still intact, so we skip the
# re-exec and continue directly.
#
# Routing:
#   no args                       → exec `sprkey` (the default)
#   first arg is an executable    → exec it directly (sleep, bash, sh, …)
#   first arg is anything else    → exec `sprkey <args>` (subcommand passthrough)
#
# Drop to sprkey via s6-setuidgid, but skip it when already non-root.

[sprkey] ERROR: container started with --user $cur_uid (an arbitrary, non-sprkey UID) — not supported.

To make container-written files match your HOST user, don't use --user.
Start as root (the default) and pass your host UID/GID instead:

    docker run -e SPRKEY_UID=\$(id -u) -e SPRKEY_GID=\$(id -g) ...

NAS users (Synology / unRAID / UGOS) can use the PUID/PGID aliases:

    docker run -e PUID=\$(id -u) -e PGID=\$(id -g) ...

The image remaps the sprkey user to that UID/GID at boot and chowns the data
volume, so files land owned by your host user — the same outcome --user gave,
without breaking the s6 supervision tree.
